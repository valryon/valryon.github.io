BulletML for Unity, a Unity plugin, is a simple and powerful wrapper around BulletML.

The plugin has been made at and is distributed by Pixelnest Studio.

It allows you to design some very complex bullet patterns with a simple XML file. It’s especially useful in “Shoot’Em Up” (shmup) games to create memorable boss fights or enemies.
