The Shmupfest is a procedural shoot them up made for the Stunfest 2014 festival.

<!--more-->

The **Shmupfest** is a game we made at Pixelnest Studio for the [Stunfest 2014][stunfest], a french video game festival based in Rennes.

**[Play the game!][play]**

It's an _infinite retro 2D Shoot'Em Up_, created with Unity. Bullets patterns are designed and implemented with _[BulletML for Unity][bulletml]_.

All the sprites have been drawn by the [Ulule's backers][ulule], making the game truly unique and personalized for the festival.
