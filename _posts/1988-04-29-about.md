title: About me!

Hello curious folk,

I am a **software and video game developper** working as a lead Unity developer. I have created <a class="pixelnest-logo" href="http://pixelnest.io">Pixelnest Studio</a> in 2013 with my friend [Matthieu Oger](https://matthieuoger.com/). We make games and apps we are proud of, like [Steredenn](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io) or [Flipon](https://flipon.net). I've joined many teams and worked on many unique projects (Lonestone Studio, Monkey Moon, Amplitude Studios).

I'm a computer and video games freak since childhood. I played a lot of games, but my love will always be to some memorable titles.

```
The Lost Vikings, Medievil, Crash Bandicoot, Warcraft 3, Zelda: Link's Awakening, Phantasy Star Online, Metal Slug, Itadaki Street, Kirby's Dreamland 2, Towerfall, Team Fortress 2, Dota, Spelunky, FTL, Perfect Dark, Worms Armageddon, Half-Life, Starfox...
```

I could be doing this list forever. [Actually, I am](/games).

I am skilled in **.NET** (I love C#) and have also worked a lot with Unity3D. But I've learned many other techs for fun or for small projects.
