Enjoy! :)

## Local server

Jekyll is now a bit outdated. Here's how I installed it in early 2022:

- Install [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/)
- `gem install github-pages`
- `gem install jekyll`
- `gem install jekyll-feed`
- `bundle install`
- `bundle update`

Start with

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
